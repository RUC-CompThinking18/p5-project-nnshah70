# Interactivity
I'll do my best to grade this category based on your intentions so good job on including that long introductory comment as requested. What you included was actually nice: good job getting the snowman's face to actually look right, no mean feat using P5's drawing capabilities. The overall plan was solid as well if it hadn't been prevented by the errors mentioned below.

# Code Quality
You did really well at navigating much of P5's documentation to accomplish what you were setting out to do. There were actually minor errors that prevented the code from working as you wished: for example, you declare "bgColor", but then refer to it later as "bgcolor". Case matters in JS, so it was calling your variables undeclared. However, you still did well at producing a lot of code in a short amount of time.

# Aesthetics
Again, I'll try to grade here based on your intentions rather than what you managed to accomplish in the short stages of the project: this was a great little project (with a well-drawn snowman) appropriate to the end of the semester. Great work.
